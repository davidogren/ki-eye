# IMPORTANT NOTES

# n.b. the SM hosts are the broker hosts

# n.b. network partition and failure detection
# is only at the engine level which means that
# each region may have an equal count of hosts
# running agents, but it is essential that the
# count of nodes running must be different.

# n.b. the sample application is deployed across
# each of the te hosts.
